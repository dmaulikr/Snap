// TODO:1 Currently the game isn’t going to be 100% fair. The player who flips a card sees that card before any of the other clients, and therefore has an advantage (it takes a few milliseconds to send out the network packets). We could compensate for this by delaying the turn-over animation for the currently active player. One way to do this is to measure the latency between the devices (the network "ping"). The server also has an advantage, because it receives the packets first and then sends out packets to the clients.

    /*
     There are basically two ways we can add single-player functionality to a multiplayer game:
     1. Keep the networking logic but instead of sending packets over the network, deliver them immediately to the clientReceivedPacket: method. The client and server logic are handled by one and the same Game object. (Of course, you can also make two different Game objects if that makes sense for your game, one that handles the client logic and one that does the server logic.).
     2. Don’t send any packets, but use timers to call the Game methods directly. This is the approach taken by Snap!, because it makes a bit more sense for our game. Each client has a slightly different view of the game world — i.e., player positions are rotated so that the client’s own player always sits at the bottom — and that makes it tricky to make Game act as both client and server.
